<article class="post-content">
  <p>The expensive shops in a famous <code class="highlighter-rouge">arcade</code> near <code class="highlighter-rouge">Piccadilly</code> were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o’colock and had only just finished. Diamond <code class="highlighter-rouge">necklaces</code> and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black <code class="highlighter-rouge">velvet</code>. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.</p>

<p>The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its <code class="highlighter-rouge">horn blaring</code>, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller’s. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings  over their faces jumped out and <code class="highlighter-rouge">smashed</code> the windows of the shop with <code class="highlighter-rouge">iron bars</code>. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">raid</code> was all over in three minutes, for the men <code class="highlighter-rouge">scrambled</code> back into the car and it moved off at a <code class="highlighter-rouge">fantastic</code> speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.</p>
