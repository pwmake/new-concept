        <title>S03E03 - An unknown goddess</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;archaeologists&lt;/code&gt; on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;on the promontory of&lt;/code&gt; Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;prosperous&lt;/code&gt;, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses – often three &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;storeys&lt;/code&gt; high – were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;drainage&lt;/code&gt; system, for a great many &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clay&lt;/code&gt; pipes were found &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;beneath&lt;/code&gt; the narrow streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;worship&lt;/code&gt; from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. In the most &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sacred&lt;/code&gt; room of the temple, clay &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fragments&lt;/code&gt; of fifteen &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;statues&lt;/code&gt; were found. Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted. The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, then were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hips&lt;/code&gt;. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>E03S02 - Thirteen equals one</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vicar&lt;/code&gt; is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired. The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One night, however, our vicar &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;woke up with a start&lt;/code&gt;: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o’clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped. Armed with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;torch&lt;/code&gt;, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, out local grocer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Whatever are you doing up here Bill?” asked the vicar in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to repair the bell, “ answered Bill. “I’ve been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You certainly did give me a surprise!” said the vicar. “you’ve probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I’m glad the bell is working again.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s the trouble, vicar, “ answered Bill. “It’s working all right, but I’m afraid that at one o’clock it will strike thirteen times and there’s nothing I can do about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll get used to that, Bill, “ said the vicar. “Thirteen is not as good as one, but it’s better than nothing. Now let’s go downstairs and have a cup of tea. “&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>E03S01 - A puma at large</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulate&lt;/code&gt;, experts from the Zoo &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;felt obliged to&lt;/code&gt; investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw ‘a large cat’ only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clinging to bushes&lt;/code&gt;. Several people complained of ‘cat-like noises’ at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were no fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from ? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;in the possession of&lt;/code&gt; a private collector and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;somehow&lt;/code&gt; managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;disturbing&lt;/code&gt; to think that a dangerous wild animal is still &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;at large&lt;/code&gt; in the quiet countryside.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>S03E11 - Not Guilty</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Customs Officers are quite &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tolerant&lt;/code&gt; these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Green Channel&lt;/code&gt; and have nothing to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/code&gt;. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hardened&lt;/code&gt; professional &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;smuggler&lt;/code&gt;, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned from aboard recentlly, a particularly &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;officious&lt;/code&gt; young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Have you anything to declare ?”&lt;/em&gt; he asked, looking me in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No,”&lt;/em&gt; I answered confidently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Not at all”&lt;/em&gt;,  I answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Officer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;went through&lt;/code&gt; the case with great care. All the things I had packed so carefully were soon in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;dreadful&lt;/code&gt; mess. I felt sure I would never be  able to close the case  again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer’s face light up. He had &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;spotted&lt;/code&gt; a tiny bottle at the buttom of my case and  he &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pounced&lt;/code&gt; on it with delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Perfume, eh?”&lt;/em&gt; He asked &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sarcastically&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;em&gt;“You should have declared that. Perfume is not &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exempt&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;import duty&lt;/code&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But it isn’t perfume, “&lt;/em&gt; I said. &lt;em&gt;“It’s hair gel. “&lt;/em&gt; Then I added with a simle, &lt;em&gt;“It’s a strange mixture I make myself.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I expected, he did not believe me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Try it!”&lt;/em&gt; I said encouragingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Officer &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unscrewed the cap&lt;/code&gt; and put the bottle to his &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nostrils&lt;/code&gt;. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;precious chalk marks&lt;/code&gt; on my baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
