  There was a time when the owner of shops and businesses in chicago had to pay large sums of money to `gangster` and `in return for` *'protection'*. If the money was not paid `promptly`.  The gangster will quickly put a man `out of bussiness` by destroy his shop. Obtaining *'protection money'* is not a modern crime. `As long ago as` the fourteen century, an Englishman Sir  John hwakwood made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroy by gangsters. 

  Six hundred years ago, Sir John hawkwood arrived in Italy with `a band of` soldiers and settled near Florence. He soon `made a name for himself` and came to be known by Italians as  Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other. Hawkwood used to hired his soliders to `princes` who were wiling to pay the high price he demanded. `In times of peace`, when business was bad, hawkwood and his men would `march into` a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away if protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way. `In spire of` this, the Italians regarded him as `a sort of ` hero. When he died at the age of eighty, the Florentines gave him a state funeral and had a picture painted which was `dedicated` to the memory of *'most `valiant` soldier and most `notable` leader, Signor Giovanni Haukodue'*.
